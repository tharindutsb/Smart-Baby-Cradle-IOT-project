Excited to share my recent IoT project – Smart Baby Cradle System 👶🛏️

This project introduces a smart cradle system that automates baby monitoring using Arduino, NodeMCU, and the Blynk IoT platform.
It features:

🎤 Cry detection & automatic cradle rocking

📦 Movement monitoring

🌡️ Temperature & humidity control (automatic fan)

💧 Diaper wetness detection with instant caregiver alerts

📱 Real-time remote monitoring via smartphone

⚙️ Smooth motor control for gentle rocking


By integrating multiple sensors with IoT connectivity, this system aims to enhance infant care, reduce manual workload for parents, and provide peace of mind through instant notifications.

This was a great experience to work on IoT, sensor integration, and real-time data handling while building something impactful.
